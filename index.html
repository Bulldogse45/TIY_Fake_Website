        <p>You're losing blood, aren't you? Probably, my socks are wet. I've been in the film business for a while but I just can't seem to get one in the can. Make love in your *own* hand, Mother! "Circumvent." It means "to go around." Gob: The old "reach around." Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we? What's gotten into you? Have you been eating cheese? Hahahahah! I just dont want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann.</p>

        <p>Annyong. Oh...yeah...the guy in the...the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! Why are you squeezing me with your body? It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. It's as Ann as the nose on Plain's face. You stay on top of her, Buddy. Don't be afraid to ride her. Hard.</p>

        <p>It walked on my pillow! I hear the jury's still out on science. I call it Tricks ... wait for it ... Around The Office. Everybody dance... NOW. I'm tired of trying to find happiness through lies and self-medicating. If you need me, I'll be at the bar.</p>

        <p>Say something that will terrify me. Lindsay: F*** me. Tobias: No, that didn't do it. Can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? That coat costs more than your house! Tobias FÃ¼nke costume. You were just a turd out there, you know? You couldn't kick, and you couldn't run, you know? You were just a turd.</p>
